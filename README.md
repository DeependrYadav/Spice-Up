## This project was developed using the java programing language and it's utilizes hibernate , mysql liberaries
Here are some additional guidelines and considerations for the project:

- Designed the database schema using MySQL to capture information related to users, recipes, and likes. Maintain appropriate relationships and constraints between tables, such as foreign keys and unique constraints.
- Use Hibernate as the ORM framework to map Java objects to database tables, providing a seamless integration between the application and the database.
- Create an ER-Diagram to visualize the database structure and relationships.
- Develop the project in a modular manner, following best practices to ensure reusability and scalability.
